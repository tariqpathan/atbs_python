Chapter 7 Questions
1. The function that creates regex objects is re.compile()

2. Raw strings are used when creating Regex objects because they are easier to read and understand - backslashes do not have to be escaped

3. The search() method returns indexes of any matches
A: Search method returns match objects

4. To get the actual strings from a pattern match, you use .group() method

5. For the regex r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)' 
Group 0 covers the initial 3 digits, Group 1 the next 7 digits with a dash between digits 3 and 4.
A: Group 0 is the entire match. Group 1 is the first set of brackets and group 2 is the second set of brackets.

6. To match brackets or full stops, you would escape them.

7. If a regex has no groups, a list of strings is returned, else a list of tuples of strings is returned.

8. The | character is the pipe symbol and signifies options. It is also known as the bitwise operator
A: Either/or

9. The ? symbol signifies 0 or 1 matches (of preceding group)

10. + = 1 or more matches, * is the wildcard operator - 0 or more

11. {3} means match at least a length of 3. {3, 5} means match a length of 3 to 5

12. \d = any digit, \w = any alphanumeric, \s = any whitespace

13. \D = not a digit, \W = not alphanumeric, \S = not a whitespace

14. .* means match length of anystring, .*? means match length of 1
* = greedy match, ? = non-greedy match

15. \d|\w | re.lowercase
A: [0-9a-z]

16. use re.I to make a case-insensitive match

17. . matches any character except newline character. re.DOTALL matches all characters including newline characters

18. X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens will be the return expression 

19. re.VERBOSE allows you specify a regex over multiple lines, for easier readability

20. (r'^\d{1,3}(,(\d{3})*$')

21. (r'[A-Z]\w* (Watanbe))

22. re.compile(r'(Alice|Bob|Carol) (eats|pets|throws) (apples|baseballs|cats).', re.I)
