Chapter 6
1. Escape characters are characters that allow you to ignore a special character

A: characters in string values that would not be otherwise possible to type into code.

2. \n represents the newline character and \t represents tab

3. A \ character can be placed in a string as \\

4. "A string with ' " This is valid because the string is intiated(?) with a double quote. Any single quotes will not close the string.

5. Instead of writing a string with the \n character you could use triple-quotes and split the string over multiple lines, using the return key

6. 'Hello, world!'[1] evaluates to 'e'
[0:5] and [:5] evaluates to 'Hello'
[3:] evaluates to 'lo, world!'

7. 'Hello'.upper() evaluates to 'HELLO'
'Hello'.upper().isupper() evaluates to True
'Hello'.upper().lower() evaluates to 'hello'

8. 'Remember, remember, the'.split() evaluates to ['Remember', 'remember', 'the']
'-'.join('There can be only one.'.split()) evaluates to 'There-can-be-only-one.'

9. .rjust(), .ljust(), .center()

10. lstrip() or rstrip() can trim whitespace characters at the beginning or end of a string.
